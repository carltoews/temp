# PoeML

**Description:**   

Exploratory code for an application to match images to poetry snippets.  The live app can be found at www.poeml.us.  

**Details:**  

During the first three weeks of my time at Insight Data Science, I worked on a project to match collections of images to relevant snippets of poetry.  The project involved several steps:  
1.  I had to scrape a bunch of poems from the web, since I couldn't find a very complete or well described pre-existing poetry database.  Some of this code is scraping code.  
2.  I end up databasing the poems in a PostgresSQL data base.  Some of this code is Python-SQL interface code.
3.  Matching is done by first extracting labels from each image, a process I achieve via Google's Cloud-Vision API.  Some of this code requires getting a cloud vision account and your own key.  

**Note:**  The code that drives the backend of this app can be found in a separate repo, "app_demo."
