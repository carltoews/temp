17,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,452,0,The Day that I was crowned Was like the other Days  Until the Coronation came  And then  twas Otherwise   As Carbon in the Coal And Carbon in the Gem Are One  and yet the former Were dull for Diadem   I rose and all was plain  But when the Day declined Myself and It in Majesty Were equally  adorned   The Grace that I  was chose  To Me  surpassed the Crown That was the Witness for the Grace  Twas even that twas Mine 
18,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,255,0,This heart that broke so long  These feet that never flagged  This faith that watched for star in vain Give gently to the dead   Hound cannot overtake the Hare That fluttered panting here  Nor any schoolboy rob the nest Tenderness builded there
19,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,602,0,A single Screw of Flesh Is all that pins the Soul That stands for Deity to Mine Upon my side the Veil   Once witnessed of the Gauze  Its name is put away As far from mine as if no plight Had printed yesterday  In tender  solemn Alphabet My eyes just turned to see When it was smuggled by my sight Into Eternity   More Hands  to hold  These are but Two  One more newmailed Nerve Just granted for the Perils sake  Some striding  Giant  Love   So greater than the Gods can show They slink before the Clay That not for all their Heaven can boast Will let its Keepsake  go

24,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,439,0,Her final Summer was it  And yet We guessed it not  If tenderer industriousness Pervaded Her We thought  A further force of life Developed from within  When Death lit all the shortness up It made the hurry plain   We wondered at our blindness When nothing was to see But Her Carrara Guide post  At Our Stupidity   When duller than our dullness The Busy Darling lay  So busy was she  finishing  So leisurely  were We

29,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,487,0,He gave away his Life  To Us  Gigantic Sum  A trifle  in his own esteem  But magnified  by Fame   Until it burst the Hearts That fancied they could hold  When swift it slipped its limit  And on the Heavens  unrolled   Tis Ours  to wince  and weep  And wonder  and decay By Blossoms gradual process  He chose  Maturity   And quickening  as we sowed  Just obviated Bud  And when We turned to note the Growth  Broke  perfect  from the Pod

33,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,226,0,That this should feel the need of Death The same as those that lived Is such a Feat of Irony As never was  achieved   Not satisfied to ape the Great In his simplicity The small must die as well as He  Oh the Audacity 
34,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,707,0,Tell as a Marksman  were forgotten Tell  this Day endures Ruddy as that coeval Apple The Tradition bears   Fresh as Mankind that humble story Though a statelier Tale Grown in the Repetition hoary Scarcely would prevail   Tell had a son  The ones that knew it Need not linger here  Those who did not to Human Nature Will subscribe a Tear   Tell would not bare his Head In Presence Of the Ducal Hat  Threatened for that with Death  by Gessler  Tyranny bethought  Make of his only Boy a Target That surpasses Death  Stolid to Loves supreme entreaty Not forsook of Faith   Mercy of the Almighty begging  Tell his Arrow sent  God it is said replies in Person When the cry is meant 
35,Emily Dickinson,1779,1830,1886,113,0,Few yet enough Enough is One  To that ethereal throng Have not each one of us the right To stealthily belong
36,Robert Frost,180,1874,1963,552,0,Tree at my window window tree My sash is lowered when night comes on But let there never be curtain drawn Between you and me Vague dreamhead lifted out of the ground And thing next most diffuse to cloud Not all your light tongues talking aloud Could be profound But tree I have seen you taken and tossed And if you have seen me when I slept You have seen me when I was taken and swept And all but lost That day she put our heads together Fate had her imagination about her Your head so much concerned with outer Mine with inner weather
37,Robert Frost,180,1874,1963,649,0,Theres a place called Faraway Meadow We never shall mow in again Or such is the talk at the farmhouse The meadow is finished with men Then now is the chance for the flowers That cant stand mowers and plowers It must be now through in season Before the not mowing brings trees on Before trees seeing the opening March into a shadowy claim The trees are all Im afraid of That flowers cant bloom in the shade of Its no more men Im afraid of The meadow is done with the tame The place for the moment is ours For you oh tumultuous flowers To go to waste and go wild in All shapes and colors of flowers I neednt call you by name
38,Robert Frost,180,1874,1963,590,0,I have been one acquainted with the night I have walked out in rain and back in rain I have outwalked the furthest city light  I have looked down the saddest city lane I have passed by the watchman on his beat And dropped my eyes unwilling to explain  I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet When far away an interrupted cry Came over houses from another street  But not to call me back or say goodbye And further still at an unearthly height One luminary clock against the sky  Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right I have been one acquainted with the night
39,Robert Frost,180,1874,1963,17411,0,I met a lady from the South who said You wont believe she said it but she said it None of my family ever worked or had A thing to sell I dont suppose the work Much matters You may work for all of me Ive seen the time Ive had to work myself The having anything to sell is what Is the disgrace in man or state or nation  I met a traveler from Arkansas Who boasted of his state as beautiful For diamonds and apples Diamonds And apples in commercial quantities I asked him on my guard Oh yes he answered Off his The time was evening in the Pullman I see the porters made your bed I told him  I met a Californian who would Talk Californiaâ€”a state so blessed He said in climate none bad ever died there A natural death and Vigilance Committees Had had to organize to stock the graveyards And vindicate the states humanity Just the way Stefansson runs on I murmured About the British Arctic Thats what comes Of being in the market with a climate  I met a poet from another state A zealot full of fluid inspiration Who in the name of fluid inspiration But in the best style of bad salesmanship Angrily tried to male me write a protest In verse I think against the Volstead Act He didnt even offer me a drink Until I asked for one to steady him This is called having an idea to sell  It never could have happened in New Hampshire  The only person really soiled with trade I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire Was someone who had just come back ashamed From selling things in California Hed built a noble mansard roof with balls On turrets like Constantinople deep In woods some ten miles from a railroad station As if to put forever out of mind The hope of being as we say received I found him standing at the close of day Inside the threshold of his open barn Like a lone actor on a gloomy stageâ€” And recognized him through the iron gray In which his face was muffled to the eyes As an old boyhood friend and once indeed A drover with me on the road to Brighton His farm was grounds and not a farm at all His house among the local sheds and shanties Rose like a factors at a trading station And be was rich and I was still a rascal I couldnt keep from asking impolitely Where bad he been and what had he been doing How did he get so Rich was understood In dealing in old rags in San Francisco Ob it was terrible as well could be We both of us turned over in our graves  Just specimens is all New Hampshire has One each of everything as in a showcase Which naturally she doesnt care to sell  She had one President Pronounce him Purse And make the most of it for better or worse Hes your one chance to score against the state She had one Daniel Webster He was all The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him  I call her old She has one family Whose claim is good to being settled here Before the era of colonization And before that of exploration even John Smith remarked them as be coasted by Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf At the Isles of Shoals and satisfied himself They werent Red Indians but veritable Preprimitives of the white race dawn people Like those who furnished Adams sons with wives However uninnocent they may have been In being there so early in our history Theyd been there then a hundred years or more Pity he didnt ask what they were up to At that date with a wharf already built And take their name Theyve since told me their nameâ€” Today an honored one in Nottingham As for what they were up to more than fishingâ€” Suppose they werent behaving Puritanly The hour bad not yet struck for being good Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical It became an explorer of the deep Not to explore too deep in others business  Did you but know of him New Hampshire has One real reformer who would change the world So it would be accepted by two classes Artists the minute they set up as artists Before that is they are themselves accepted And boys the minute they get out of college I cant help thinking those are tests to go by  And she has one I dont know what to call him Who comes from Philadelphia every year With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds He wants to give the educational Advantages of growing almost wild Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle         Dorkings because theyre spoken of by Chaucer Sussex because theyre spoken of by Herrick  She has a touch of gold New Hampshire goldâ€” You may have heard of it I had a farm Offered me not long since up Berlin way With a mine on it that was worked for gold But not gold in commercial quantities Just enough gold to make the engagement rings And marriage rings of those who owned the farm What gold more innocent could one have asked for One of my children ranging after rocks Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan A specimen of beryl with a trace Of radium I know with radium The trace would have to be the merest trace      To be below the threshold of commercial But trust New Hampshire not to have enough Of radium or anything to sell  A specimen of everything I said She has one witchâ€”old style She lives in Colebrook The only other witch I ever met Was lately at a cutglass dinner in Boston There were four candles and four people present The witch was young and beautiful new style And openminded She was free to question Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes Why was it so much greater when the boxes Were metal than it was when they were wooden It made the world seem so mysterious The Sciety for Psychical Research Was cognizant Her husband was worth millions I think he owned some shares in Harvard College  New Hampshire used to have at Salem A company we called the White Corpuscles Whose duty was at any hour of night To rush in sheets and fools caps where they smelled A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented And give someone the Skipper Iresons Ride  One each of everything as in a showcase  More than enough land for a specimen Youll say she has but there there enters in Something else to protect her from herself There quality makes up for quantity Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale The farm I made my home on in the mountains    had to take by force rather than buy  I caught the owner outdoors by himself Rakingup after winter and I said â€œIâ€™m going to put you off this farm I want it â€œWhere are you going to put me In the roadâ€ â€œIâ€™m going to put you on the farm next to itâ€ â€œWhy wont the farm next to it do for you I like this better It was really better  Apples New Hampshire has them but unsprayed With no suspicion in stern end or blossom end   Of vitriol or arsenate of lead And so not good for anything but cider Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats Far up the birches out of reach of man  A state producing precious metals stones Andâ€”writing none of these except perhaps The precious literature in quantity Or quality to worry the producer About disposing of it Do you know Considering the market there are more Poems produced than any other thing No wonder poets sometimes have to seem So much more businesslike than businessmen Their wares are so much harder to get rid of  Shes one of the two best states in the Union Vermonts the other And the two have been Yokefellows in the sap yoke from of old In many Marches And they lie like wedges Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end And are a figure of the way the strong Of mind and strong of arm should fit together One thick where one is thin and vice versa     New Hampshire raises the Connecticut 	   In a trout hatchery near Canada But soon divides the river with Vermont Both are delightful states for their absurdly Small townsâ€”Lost Nation Bungey Muddy Boo Poplin Still Corners so called not because The place is silent all day long nor yet Because it boasts a whisky stillâ€”because It set out once to be a city and still Is only corners crossroads in a wood And I remember one whose name appeared Between the pictures on a movie screen Election night once in Franconia When everything had gone Republican And Democrats were sore in need of comfort Easton goes Democratic Wilson  Hughes  And everybody to the saddest Laughed the loud laugh the big laugh at the little New York five million laughs at Manchester Manchester sixty or seventy thousand laughs At Littleton four thousand Littleton Laughs at Franconia seven hundred and Franconia laughs I fearâ€”did laugh that nightÂ­ At Easton What has Easton left to laugh at And like the actress exclaim Oh my God at Theres Bungey and for Bungey there are towns Whole townships named but without population  Anything I can say about New Hampshire Will serve almost as well about Vermont Excepting that they differ in their mountains The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight New Hampshire mountains Curl up in a coil  I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains And here I am and what am I to say Here first my theme becomes embarrassing Emerson said The God who made New Hampshire Taunted the lofty land with little men Anotner Massachusetts poet said         I go no more to summer in New Hampshire Ive given up my summer place in Dublin But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire She said she couldnt stand the people in it The little men its Massachusetts speaking      And when I asked to know what ailed the people She said Go read your own books and find out I may as well confess myself the author Of several books against the world in general To take them as against a special state   Or even nations to restrict my meaning Im what is called a sensibilitist Or otherwise an environmentalist I refuse to adapt myself a mite To any change from hot to cold from wet         To dry from poor to rich or back again I make a virtue of my suffering From nearly everything that goes on round me In other words I know wherever I am Being the creature of literature I am       sball not lack for pain to keep me awake Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers Why this is Hell nor am I out of it Samoa Russia Ireland I complain of No less than England France and Italy            Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire When I left Massachusetts years ago Between two days the reason why I sought New Hampshire not Connecticut Rhode Island New York or Vermont was this Where I was living then New Hampshire offered The nearest boundary to escape across I hadnt an illusion in my handbag About the people being better there Than those I left behind I thought they werent  I thought they couldnt be And yet they were Id sure had no such friends in Massachusetts As Hall of Windham Gay of Atkinson Bartlett of Raymond now of Colorado Harris of Derry and Lynch of Bethlehem  The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem To want to make New Hampshire people over They taunt the lofty land with little men I dont know what to say about the people For arts sake one could almost wish them worse Rather than better How are we to write The Russian novel in America As long as life goes so unterribly There is the pinch from which our only outcry    In literature to date is heard to come We get what little misery we can Out of not having cause for misery It makes the guild of novel writers sick To be expected to be Dostoievskis On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort This is not sorrow though its just the vapors And recognized as such in Russia itself Under the new regime and so forbidden  If well it is with Russia then feel free      To say so or be stood against the wall And shot Its Pollyanna now or death This then is the new freedom we hear tell of And very sensible No state can build A literature that shall at once be sound And sad on a foundation of wellbeing   To show the level of intelligence Among us it was just a Warren farmer Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road By me a stranger This is what he said From nothing but embarrassment and want Of anything more sociable to say You hear those bound dogs sing on Moosilauke Well they remind me of the hue and cry Weve heard against the Mid  Victorians            And never rightly understood till Bryan Retired from politics and joined the chorus The matter with the MidVictorians Seems to have been a man named Joh n L Darwin Go long I said to him he to his horse   I knew a man who failing as a farmer Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance And spent the proceeds on a telescope To satisfy a lifelong curiosity About our place among the infinities And how was that for otherworldliness  If I must choose which I would elevate â€” The people or the already lofty mountains Id elevate the already lofty mountains The only fault I find with old New Hampshire    Is that her mountains arent quite high enough I was not always so Ive come to be so How to my sorrow how have I attained A height from which to look down critical On mountains What has given me assurance  To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains Or any mountains Can it be some strength I feel as of an earthquake in my back To heave them higher to the morning star Can it be foreign travel in the Alps Or having seen and credited a moment The solid molding of vast peaks of cloud Behind the pitiful reality Of Lincoln Lafayette and Liberty Or some such sense as says bow high shall jet The fountain in proportion to the basin No none of these has raised me to my throne Of intellectual dissatisfaction But the sad accident of having seen Our actual mountains given in a map Of early times as twice the height they areâ€” Ten thousand feet instead of only fiveâ€” Which shows how sad an accident may be Five thousand is no longer high enough Whereas I never had a good idea About improving people in the world Here I am overfertile in suggestion And cannot rest from planning day or night How high Id thrust the peaks in summer snow To tap the upper sky and draw a flow Of frosty night air on the vale below Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry  The more the sensibilitist I am The more I seem to want my mountains wild The way the wiry gangboss liked the logjam    After hed picked the lock and got it started He dodged a log that lifted like an arm Against the sky to break his back for him Then came in dancing skipping with his life Across the roar and chaos and the words         We saw him say along the zigzag journey Were doubtless as the words we heard him say On coming nearer Wasnt she an ideal Sonofabitch You bet she was an ideal  For all her mountains fall a little short Her people not quite short enough for Art Shes still New Hampshire a most restful state  Lately in converse with a New York alec About the new school of the pseudophallic I found myself in a close corner where I bad to make an almost funny choice Choose you which you will beâ€”a prude or puke Mewling and puking in the public arms Me for the hills where I donâ€™t have to chooseâ€ But if you bad to choose which would you be            wouldnt be a prude afraid of nature I know a man who took a double ax And went alone against a grove of trees But his heart failing him he dropped the ax And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold Nature is cruel man is sick of blood There s been enough shed without shedding mine Remember Birnam Wood The woods in flux  He had a special terror of the flux That showed itself in dendrophobia The only decent tree had been to mill And educated into boards be said He knew too well for any earthly use The line where man leaves off and nature starts And never overstepped it save in dreams He stood on the safe side of the line talkingâ€” Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism The cult of one who owned himself a foiled Circuitous wanderer and took dejectedly His seat upon the intellectual throneâ€” Agreed in frowning on these improvised Altars the woods are full of nowadays Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned By worship under green trees in the open Scarcely a mile but that I come on one A blackchecked stone and stick of rainwashed charcoal Even to say the groves were Gods first temples Comes too near to Ahaz sin for safety Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred But here is not a question of whats sacred Rather of what to face or run away from Id hate to be a runaway from nature And neither would I choose to be a puke Who cares not what be does in company And when he cant do anything falls back On words and tries his worst to make words speak Louder than actions and sometimes achieves it It seems a narrow choice the age insists on ow about being a good Greek for instance That course they tell me isnt offered this year Come but this isnt choosingâ€”puke or prude  Well if I have to choose one or the other I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer With an income in cash of say a thousand From say a publisher in New York City       Its restful to arrive at a decision And restful just to think about New Hampshire At present I am

51,Robert Frost,180,1874,1963,393,0,We make ourselves a place apart Behind light words that tease and flout But oh the agitated hear Till someone really find us out  Tis pity if the case require Or so we say that in the end We speak the literal to inspire The understanding of a friend  But so with all from babes that play At hidandseek to God afar So all who hide too well away Must speak and tell us where they are

74,Wallace Stevens,33,1879,1955,367,0,The houses are haunted By white nightgowns None are green Or purple with green rings Or green with yellow rings Or yellow with blue rings None of them are strange With socks of lace And beaded ceintures People are not going To dream of baboons and periwinkles Only here and there an old sailor Drunk and asleep in his boots Catches Tigers In red weather
75,Wallace Stevens,33,1879,1955,345,0,The light is like a spider It crawls over the water It crawls over the edges of the snow It crawls under your eyelids And spreads its webs there Its two webs  The webs of your eyes Are fastened To the flesh and bones of you As to rafters or grass  There are filaments of your eyes On the surface of the water And in the edges of the snow
76,Wallace Stevens,33,1879,1955,1034,0,The difficulty to think at the end of day When the shapeless shadow covers the sun And nothing is left except light on your furâ€”  There was the cat slopping its milk all day Fat cat red tongue green mind white milk And August the most peaceful month  To be in the grass in the peacefullest time Without that monument of cat  The cat forgotten on the moon  And to feel that the light is a rabbitlight In which everything is meant for you And nothing need be explained  Then there is nothing to think of It comes of it self And east rushes west and west rushes down No matter The grass is full  And full of yourself The trees around are for you The whole of the wideness of night is for you A self that touches all edges  You become a self that fills the four corners of   night The red cat hides away in the furlight And there you are humped high humped up  You are humped higher and higher black as    stoneâ€” You sit with your head like a carving in space And the little green cat is a bug in the grass
77,Wallace Stevens,33,1879,1955,865,0,Children picking up our bones Will never know that these were once As quick as foxes on the hill  And that in autumn when the grapes Made sharp air sharper by their smell These had a being breathing frost  And least will guess that with our bones We left much more left what still is The look of things left what we felt   At what we saw The spring clouds blow Above the shuttered mansionhouse Beyond our gate and the windy sky  Cries out a literate despair We knew for long the mansions look And what we said of it became  A part of what it is    Children Still weaving budded aureoles Will speak our speech and never know  Will say of the mansion that it seems As if he that lived there left behind A spirit storming in blank walls   A dirty house in a gutted world A tatter of shadows peaked to white Smeared with the gold of the opulent sun
78,Wallace Stevens,33,1879,1955,4947,0,  Complacencies of the peignoir and late Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair And the green freedom of a cockatoo Upon a rug mingle to dissipate The holy hush of ancient sacrifice She dreams a little and she feels the dark Encroachment of that old catastrophe As a calm darkens among waterlights The pungent oranges and bright green wings Seem things in some procession of the dead Winding across wide water without sound The day is like wide water without sound Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet Over the seas to silent Palestine Dominion of the blood and sepulchre    Why should she give her bounty to the dead What is divinity if it can come Only in silent shadows and in dreams Shall she not find in comforts of the sun In pungent fruit and bright green wings or else In any balm or beauty of the earth Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven Divinity must live within herself Passions of rain or moods in falling snow Grievings in loneliness or unsubdued Elations when the forest blooms gusty Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights All pleasures and all pains remembering The bough of summer and the winter branch These are the measure destined for her soul    Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth No mother suckled him no sweet land gave Largemannered motions to his mythy mind He moved among us as a muttering king Magnificent would move among his hinds Until our blood commingling virginal With heaven brought such requital to desire The very hinds discerned it in a star Shall our blood fail Or shall it come to be The blood of paradise And shall the earth Seem all of paradise that we shall know The sky will be much friendlier then than now A part of labor and a part of pain And next in glory to enduring love Not this dividing and indifferent blue    She says I am content when wakened birds Before they fly test the reality Of misty fields by their sweet questionings But when the birds are gone and their warm fields Return no more where then is paradise There is not any haunt of prophecy Nor any old chimera of the grave Neither the golden underground nor isle Melodious where spirits gat them home Nor visionary south nor cloudy palm Remote on heavens hill that has endured As Aprils green endures or will endure Like her remembrance of awakened birds Or her desire for June and evening tipped By the consummation of the swallows wings    She says But in contentment I still feel The need of some imperishable bliss Death is the mother of beauty hence from her Alone shall come fulfillment to our dreams And our desires Although she strews the leaves Of sure obliteration on our paths The path sick sorrow took the many paths Where triumph rang its brassy phrase or love Whispered a little out of tenderness She makes the willow shiver in the sun For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze Upon the grass relinquished to their feet She causes boys to pile new plums and pears On disregarded plate The maidens taste And stray impassioned in the littering leaves    Is there no change of death in paradise Does ripe fruit never fall Or do the boughs Hang always heavy in that perfect sky Unchanging yet so like our perishing earth With rivers like our own that seek for seas They never find the same receding shores That never touch with inarticulate pang Why set pear upon those riverbanks Or spice the shores with odors of the plum Alas that they should wear our colors there The silken weavings of our afternoons And pick the strings of our insipid lutes Death is the mother of beauty mystical Within whose burning bosom we devise Our earthly mothers waiting sleeplessly    Supple and turbulent a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun Not as a god but as a god might be Naked among them like a savage source Their chant shall be a chant of paradise Out of their blood returning to the sky And in their chant shall enter voice by voice The windy lake wherein their lord delights The trees like serafin and echoing hills That choir among themselves long afterward They shall know well the heavenly fellowship Of men that perish and of summer morn And whence they came and whither they shall go The dew upon their feel shall manifest    She hears upon that water without sound A voice that cries The tomb in Palestine Is not the porch of spirits lingering It is the grave of Jesus where he lay We live in an old chaos of the sun Or old dependency of day and night Or island solitude unsponsored free Of that wide water inescapable Deer walk upon our mountains and the quail Whistle about us their spontaneous cries Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness And in the isolation of the sky At evening casual flocks of pigeons make Ambiguous undulations as they sink Downward to darkness on extended wings
