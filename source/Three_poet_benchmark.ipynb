      "Line: Mary sat musing on the lampflame at the table Waiting for Warren When she heard his step She ran on tiptoe down the darkened passage To meet him in the doorway with the news And put him on his guard Silas is back She pushed him outward with her through the door And shut it after her Be kind she said She took the market things from Warrens arms And set them on the porch then drew him down To sit beside her on the wooden steps When was I ever anything but kind to him But Ill not have the fellow back he said I told him so last haying didnt I If he left then I said that ended it What good is he Who else will harbour him At his age for the little he can do What help he is theres no depending on Off he goes always when I need him most He thinks he ought to earn a little pay Enough at least to buy tobacco with wont have to beg and be beholden All right I say I cant afford to pay Any fixed wages though I wish I could Someone else can Then someone else will have to I shouldnt mind his bettering himself If that was what it was You can be certain When he begins like that theres someone at him Trying to coax him off with pocketmoney  In haying time when any help is scarce In winter he comes back to us Im done Shh I not so loud hell hear you Mary said I want him to hell have to soon or late Hes worn out Hes asleep beside the stove When I came up from Rowes I found him here Huddled against the barndoor fast asleep A miserable sight and frightening too You neednt smile  I didnt recognize him I wasnt looking for him and hes changed Wait till you see Where did you say hed been He didnt say I dragged him to the house And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke I tried to make him talk about his travels Nothing would do he just kept nodding off What did he say Did he say anything But little Anything Mary confess He said hed come to ditch the meadow for me Warren But did he I just want to know Of course he did What would you have him say Surely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man Some humble way to save his selfrespect He added if you really care to know He meant to dear the upper pasture too That sounds like something you have heard before Warren I wish you could have heard the way He jumbled everything I stopped to look Two or three times  he made me feel so queer To see if he was talking in his sleep He ran on Harold Wilson  you remember  The boy you had in haying four years since Hes finished school and teaching in his college Silas declares youll have to get him back He says they two will make a team for work Between them they will lay this farm as smooth The way he mixed that in with other things He thinks young Wilson a likely lad though daft On education  you know how they fought  All through July under the blazing sun Silas up on the cart to build the load Harold along beside to pitch it on Yes I took care to keep well out of earshot Well those days trouble Silas like a dream You wouldnt think they would How some things linger Harolds young college boys assurance piqued him After so many years he still keeps finding Good arguments he sees he might have used I sympathize I know just how it feels To think of the right thing to say too late Harolds associated in his mind with Latin He asked me what I thought of Harolds saying He studied Latin like the violin Because he liked it  that an argument He said he couldnt make the boy believe He could find water with a hazel prong Which showed how much good school had ever done him He wanted to go over that But most of all He thinks if he could have another chance To teach him how to build a load of hay  I know thats Silas one accomplishment He bundles every forkful in its place And tags and numbers it for future reference So he can find and easily dislodge it In the unloading Silas does that well He takes it out in bunches like big birds nests You never see him standing on the hay Hes trying to lift straining to lift himself He thinks if he could teach him that hed be  Some good perhaps to someone in the world He hates to see a boy the fool of books Poor Silas so concerned for other folk And nothing to look backward to with pride And nothing to look forward to with hope So now and never any different Part of a moon was filling down the west Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills Its light poured softly in her lap She saw And spread her apron to it She put out her hand Among the harplike morningglory strings Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves As if she played unheard the tenderness That wrought on him beside her in the night Warren she said he has come home to die You neednt be afraid hell leave you this time Home he mocked gently Yes what else but home It all depends on what you mean by home Of course hes nothing to us any more then was the hound that came a stranger to us Out of the woods worn out upon the trail Home is the place where when you have to go there They have to take you in I should have called it Something you somehow havent to deserve Warren leaned out and took a step or two Picked up a little stick and brought it back And broke it in his hand and tossed it by Silas has better claim on us you think Than on his brother Thirteen little miles As the road winds would bring him to his door Silas has walked that far no doubt today Why didnt he go there His brothers rich A somebody director in the bank He never told us that We know it though I think his brother ought to help of course Ill see to that if there is need He ought of right To take him in and might be willing to He may be better than appearances But have some pity on Silas Do you think If hed had any pride in claiming kin Or anything he looked for from his brother Hed keep so still about him all this time I wonder whats between them I can tell you Silas is what he is  we wouldnt mind him But just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide He never did a thing so very bad He dont know why he isnt quite as good As anyone He wont be made ashamed To please his brother worthless though he is I cant think Si ever hurt anyone No but he hurt my heart the way he lay And rolled his old head on that sharpedged chairback He wouldnt let me put him on the lounge You must go in and see what you can do I made the bed up for him there tonight Youll be surprised at him  how much hes broken His working days are done Im sure of it Id not be in a hurry to say that I havent been Go look see for yourself But Warren please remember how it is He come to help you ditch the meadow He has a plan You mustnt laugh at him He may not speak of it and then he may Ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud Will hit or miss the moon It hit the moonThen there were three there making a dim row The moon the little silver cloud and she Warren returned too soon it seemed to her Slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited Warren she questioned Dead was all he answered (with polarity 0.0552314071696094) \n",

      "Line: I didnt make you know how glad I was  To have you come and camp here on our land  I promised myself to get down some day  And see the way you lived but I dont know  With a houseful of hungry men to feed  I guess youd find It seems to me  I cant express my feelings any more  Than I can raise my voice or want to lift  My hand oh I can lift it when I have to  Did ever you feel so I hope you never  Its got so I dont even know for sure  Whether I am glad sorry or anything  Theres nothing but a voicelike left inside  That seems to tell me how I ought to feel  And would feel if I wasnt all gone wrong  You take the lake I look and look at it  I see its a fair pretty sheet of water  I stand and make myself repeat out loud  The advantages it has so long and narrow  Like a deep piece of some old running river  Cut short off at both ends It lies five miles  Straight away through the mountain notch  From the sink window where I wash the plates  And all our storms come up toward the house  Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter  It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit  To step outdoors and take the water dazzle  A sunny morning or take the rising wind  About my face and body and through my wrapper  When a storm threatened from the Dragons Den  And a cold chill shivered across the lake  I see its a fair pretty sheet of water  Our Willoughby How did you hear of it  I expect though everyones heard of it  In a book about ferns Listen to that  You let things more like feathers regulate  Your going and coming And you like it here  I can see how you might But I dont know  It would be different if more people came  For then there would be business As it is  The cottages Len built sometimes we rent them  Sometimes we dont Weve a good piece of shore  That ought to be worth something and may yet  But I dont count on it as much as Len  He looks on the bright side of everything  Including me He thinks Ill be all right  With doctoring But its not medicine  Lowe is the only doctors dared to say so  Its rest I wantthere I have said it out  From cooking meals for hungry hired men  And washing dishes after themfrom doing  Things over and over that just wont stay done  By good rights I ought not to have so much  Put on me but there seems no other way  Len says one steady pull more ought to do it  He says the best way out is always through  And I agree to that or in so far  As that I can see no way out but through  Leastways for meand then theyll be convinced  Its not that Len dont want the best for me  It was his plan our moving over in  Beside the lake from where that day I showed you  We used to liveten miles from anywhere  We didnt change without some sacrifice  But Len went at it to make up the loss  His works a mans of course from sun to sun  But he works when he works as hard as I do  Though theres small profit in comparisons  Women and men will make them all the same  But work aint all Len undertakes too much  Hes into everything in town This year  Its highways and hes got too many men  Around him to look after that make waste  They take advantage of him shamefully  And proud too of themselves for doing so  We have four here to board great goodfornothings  Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk  While I fry their bacon Much they care  No more put out in what they do or say  Than if I wasnt in the room at all  Coming and going all the time they are  I dont learn what their names are let alone  Their characters or whether they are safe  To have inside the house with doors unlocked  Im not afraid of them though if theyre not  Afraid of me Theres two can play at that  I have my fancies it runs in the family  My fathers brother wasnt right They kept him  Locked up for years back there at the old farm  Ive been away onceyes Ive been away  The State Asylum I was prejudiced  I wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there  You know the old ideathe only asylum  Was the poorhouse and those who could afford  Rather than send their folks to such a place  Kept them at home and it does seem more human  But its not so the place is the asylum  There they have every means proper to do with  And you arent darkening other peoples lives  Worse than no good to them and they no good  To you in your condition you cant know  Affection or the want of it in that state  Ive heard too much of the oldfashioned way  My fathers brother he went mad quite young  Some thought he had been bitten by a dog  Because his violence took on the form  Of carrying his pillow in his teeth  But its more likely he was crossed in love  Or so the story goes It was some girl  Anyway all he talked about was love  They soon saw he would do someone a mischief  If he want kept strict watch of and it ended  In fathers building him a sort of cage  Or room within a room of hickory poles  Like stanchions in the barn from floor to ceiling  A narrow passage all the way around  Anything they put in for furniture  Hed tear to pieces even a bed to lie on  So they made the place comfortable with straw  Like a beasts stall to ease their consciences  Of course they had to feed him without dishes  They tried to keep him clothed but he paraded  With his clothes on his armall of his clothes  Cruelit sounds I spose they did the best  They knew And just when he was at the height  Father and mother married and mother came  A bride to help take care of such a creature  And accommodate her young life to his  That was what marrying father meant to her  She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful  By his shouts in the night Hed shout and shout  Until the strength was shouted out of him  And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion  Hed pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring  And let them go and make them twang until  His hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow  And then hed crow as if he thought that childs play  The only fun he had Ive heard them say though  They found a way to put a stop to it  He was before my timeI never saw him  But the pen stayed exactly as it was  There in the upper chamber in the ell  A sort of catchall full of attic clutter  I often think of the smooth hickory bars  It got so I would sayyou know half fooling  Its time I took my turn upstairs in jail  Just as you will till it becomes a habit  No wonder I was glad to get away  Mind you I waited till Len said the word  I didnt want the blame if things went wrong  I was glad though no end when we moved out  And I looked to be happy and I was  As I said for a whilebut I dont know  Somehow the change wore out like a prescription  And theres more to it than just windowviews  And living by a lake Im past such help  Unless Len took the notion which he wont  And I wont ask himits not sure enough  I spose Ive got to go the road Im going  Other folks have to and why shouldnt I  I almost think if I could do like you  Drop everything and live out on the ground  But it might be come night I shouldnt like it  Or a long rain I should soon get enough  And be glad of a good roof overhead  Ive lain awake thinking of you Ill warrant  More than you have yourself some of these nights  The wonder was the tents werent snatched away  From over you as you lay in your beds  I havent courage for a risk like that  Bless you of course youre keeping me from work  But the thing of it is I need to be kept  Theres work enough to dotheres always that  But behinds behind The worst that you can do  Is set me back a little more behind  I shant catch up in this world anyway Id rather youd not go unless you must (with

run wild in the summera little wild  Sometimes he joins them for a day or two  And sees old friends he somehow cant get near  They meet him in the general store at night  Preoccupied with formidable mail  Rifling a printed letter as he talks  They seem afraid He wouldnt have it so  Though a great scholar hes a democrat  If not at heart at least on principle  Lately when coming up to Lancaster  His train being late he missed another train  And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction  After eleven oclock at night Too tired  To think of sitting such an ordeal out  He turned to the hotel to find a bed  No room the night clerk said Unless  Woodsvilles a place of shrieks and wandering lamps  And cars that shook and rattleand one hotel  You say unless  Unless you wouldnt mind  Sharing a room with someone else  Who is it  A man  So I should hope What kind of man  I know him hes all right A mans a man  Separate beds of course you understand  The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on  Whos that man sleeping in the office chair  Has he had the refusal of my chance  He was afraid of being robbed or murdered  What do you say  Ill have to have a bed  The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs  And down a narrow passage full of doors  At the last one of which he knocked and entered  Lafe heres a fellow wants to share your room  Show him this way Im not afraid of him  Im not so drunk I cant take care of myself  The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot  This will be yours Goodnight he said and went  Lafe was the name I think  Yes Layfayette  You got it the

Man that knew anything I happened in with  Ill ask you laterdont let me forget it  The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away  A man A brute Naked above the waist  He sat there creased and shining in the light  Fumbling the buttons in a wellstarched shirt  Im moving into a sizelarger shirt  Ive felt mean lately means no name for it  I just found what the matter was tonight  Ive been achoking like a nursery tree  When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag  I blamed it on the hot spell weve been having  Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back  Not liking to own up Id grown a size  Number eighteen this is What size do you wear  The Doctor caught his throat convulsively  Ohahfourteenfourteen  Fourteen You say so  I can remember when I wore fourteen  And come to think I must have back at home  More than a hundred collars size fourteen  Too bad to waste them all You ought to have them  Theyre yours and welcome let me send them to you  What makes you stand there on one leg like that  Youre not much furtherer than where Kike left you  You act as if you wished you hadnt come  Sit down or lie down friend you make me nervous  The Doctor made a subdued dash for it  And propped himself at bay against a pillow  Not that way with your shoes on Kikes white bed  You cant rest that way Let me pull your shoes off  Dont touch me pleaseI say dont touch me please  Ill not be put to bed by you my man  Just as you say Have it your own way then  My man is it You talk like a professor  Speaking of whos afraid of who however  Im thinking I have more to lose than you  If anything should happen to be wrong  Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat  Lets have a show down as an evidence  Of good faith There is ninety dollars  Come if youre not afraid  Im not afraid  Theres five

 Its business but I cant say its not fun  What I like bests the lay of different farms  Coming out on them from a stretch of woods  Or over a hill or round a sudden corner  I like to find folks getting out in spring  Raking the dooryard working near the house  Later they get out further in the fields  Everythings shut sometimes except the barn  The familys all away in some back meadow  Theres a hay load acomingwhen it comes  And later still they all get driven in  The fields are stripped to lawn the garden patches  Stripped to bare ground the apple trees  To whips and poles Theres nobody about  The chimney though keeps up a good brisk smoking  And I lie back and ride I take the reins  Only when someones coming and the mare  Stops when she likes I tell her when to go  Ive
